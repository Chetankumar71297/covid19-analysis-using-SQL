## Data Characteristics:

The actual data is regularly updataed on a day or weekly 
basis.I downloaded this dataset on 2May/2022.
While downloading,it was a single csv file which i further
split into two separate datasets using Exel.Name of these two 
separate files are CovidDeaths.xlsx and CovidVaccinations.xlsx.


## Final observation

- Europe has the highest death count among other continents
- United States suffered from highest deaths among other countries
- More than 6201514 deaths reported all over the world
- Low income Asian and African countries like India,Pakistan etc.
  performed really well dispite of there large population
  and remain successful in keeping there death counts low.
